- Ambush Mission


Description

Hi, i can't tell you my name since now i'm in a mission. In case to arrest our fugitive target, our team had been intercepted communication between the target with his fellow and found this image (https://mega.nz/#!TKZ3DabY!BEUHD7VJvq_b-M22eD4VfHv_PPBnW2m7CZUfMbveZYw). It looks like they are going to meet in specific place, but we still don't know the time yet. Can you help me?

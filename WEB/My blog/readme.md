- My Blog

Hi, I'm Noxtal! I have hidden a flag somewhere in my Cyberworld (AKA blog)... you may find a good application for your memory. ;)

Note: This is my real website (thus no deadly bug to exploit here). You might want to read some of my content (writeups, tutorials, and cheatsheets). I would be glad to receive any kind of feedback

![Click Here](https://noxtal.com) to access it, have fun checking my blog out! Cheers!

Hint: replace the flag{} part with CTFlearn{}.

first go to the blog page and use developers tool on your browser

get to a storage and look to the local storage and found key and value
of flag.
